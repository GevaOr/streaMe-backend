# streaMe-backend
The backend of StreaMe, a music streaming service I built as an exercise in React, Material-UI, Node.js, and MySQL. 

use the DBCreation.sql file to create the initial database, it comes with some dummy data for your convenience.


# What I learned
This is the first full-stack (client, server, api) project I made, it is far from perfect but it helped me understant React components, Material-UI, axios, express and time management better.
